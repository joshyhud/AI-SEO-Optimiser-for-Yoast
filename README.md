## Development and Compilation with Sass

To amend development and compile styling with Sass, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Sass installed on your system. If not, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g sass
```

2. Create a new file called `styles.scss` in your project directory. This file will contain your Sass code.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `styles.scss` file is located.

4. Run the following command to start watching the `styles.scss` file for changes and automatically compile it to `styles.min.css`:

```
sass --watch styles.scss:styles.min.css --style compressed
```

This command tells Sass to watch the `styles.scss` file and compile it to `styles.min.css` with the `compressed` style option, which minifies the output CSS.

5. Now, whenever you make changes to the `styles.scss` file and save it, Sass will automatically compile the updated code to `styles.min.css`.

Note: If you prefer a different output style, you can replace `compressed` with `expanded`, `nested`, or `compact` in the command.
